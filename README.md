# Analysis Program for analyszing GUV geometry and protein bindings in Time Lapse 3D Confocal Stacks

## Brief Overview

Python programs for analyzing GUV geometry (e.g. Volume, radius) and protein bindings in confocal time lapse data (It also works with single time points). Generally, the program accepts input of a 4D confocal stack plus time (TZYX). But it can also accept single z image (TYX). Below is a schematic illustrating the pipeline workflow:
